# Digital-Voltmeter-Simulation-in-LabVIEW
This project simulates a digital voltmeter using LabVIEW. It generates a random voltage value continuously and displays the voltage on both a digital numeric indicator and a waveform chart in real-time. The program includes user controls to start, stop, and control the speed of data updates.
