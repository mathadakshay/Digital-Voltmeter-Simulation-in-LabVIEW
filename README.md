This project demonstrates a virtual digital voltmeter developed using LabVIEW. The program simulates voltage measurement by generating random voltage values and displays these values in real-time through a digital indicator and a waveform chart. The application includes a user-friendly front panel interface with controls to start, stop, and visualize the simulated voltage data.

Key features include:
- Simulated voltage signal generation
- Real-time numerical display of voltage
- Visualization of voltage changes over time using waveform chart
- Manual control to stop data acquisition

This project highlights basic LabVIEW skills such as data acquisition simulation, GUI design, and loop control, which are essential in electrical measurement and testing systems.
